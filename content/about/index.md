Hello! I'm Alif, a software engineer based in Bandung, ID who enjoys building things that live on the internet. I develop exceptional websites and web apps that provide intuitive, pixel-perfect user interfaces with efficient and modern backends.

I'm fresh graduate from [Institut Teknologi Nasional](https://www.itenas.ac.id/) and have my own business [Journey Wear Production](https://myjwp.com) whitch is a custom clothing manufacturing service company. I made a business in two years ago with [Fuad Hasan](https://instagram.com/fuadh.h), [Zulian Hidayat](https://www.instagram.com/jullmuhammad/), [Adi Subadgja](https://www.instagram.com/muhammadadisubagja/), [Erwin](https://www.instagram.com/erwinjuans/), and [Alfi Darmawan](https://www.instagram.com/alfii.d/)
